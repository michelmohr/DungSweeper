replace the CameraManager script etc with some better encapsulated things that can stand alone.
eg: cameraMover accepts a Window instead of a string, so the cameraMover is not tied to the implementation of the WindowManager

BUT, that way I can't link easily using a clickevent, as that only accepts a string and not a window? but it does if you drag a component
we'll see.



ScreenTransitionManager -> ScreenTransitionData
WindowManager -> Window
CameraMover
